# myEvolvCode/SQL

This folder contains SQL snippets / views which may come in handy when creating a Virtual View in myEvolv.

You may submit code here under a `.sql` file or under a `.md` file. The former will apply standard SQL formatting to the file when viewing it on GitHub, while the latter allows you to use Markdown formatting when explaining how your script works.

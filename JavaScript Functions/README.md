# myEvolvCode/JavaScript

This folder contains JavaScript code / snippets which may come in handy when creating or designing Forms in myEvolv.

You may submit code here under a `.js` file or under a `.md` file. The former will apply standard JavaScript formatting to the file when viewing it on GitHub, while the latter allows you to use Markdown formatting when explaining how your script works.

## General Rules
1. Do not post any PHI
    - Self explanatory.
    - This includes screenshots.
    - **If a pull request has PHI in it, do not submit the pull request. Once it’s on GitHub, assume that it cannot be taken off and that it’s visible to anyone on the internet.**
2. Do not post proprietary NetSmart content
    - Example of non-proprietary code:

    ```
    getFormElement(‘actual_date’);
    ```
    - Example of proprietary code:

    ```
    getFormElement = function(columnName) {
	    (... code that Netsmart wrote to define the getFormElement function ...)
    }
    ```
3. Be nice! Be patient!
    - Community members who wish to **make contributions** are expected to follow guidelines to the best of their ability and **submit a pull request**, but they should not be expected to understand GitHub nearly as well as members of the subcommittee.
    - If community members have **questions** about code on the repository, they should **submit an issue**. Questions about content on GitHub should be kept on GitHub. Contacting subcommittee members via any means other than communicating on GitHub is considered inappropriate and will result in a ban from participation.
4. Format code in a way that a stranger five years from now will understand.
    - Include comments within the code.
5. Do not assume that code contained in the repository will work.
    - All code submitted to the repository comes with the following disclaimer:

    > If the code you see here worked for someone else at some point in time, that does not mean it will work for you now. myEvolv is updated regularly thanks to the team at NetSmart. Functionality available in a prior version of myEvolv may not be available in a future version. **If you plan to use code from here, be sure to test it on your systems in a development environment before using it in production.**
